This program generates a random password based on user selected criteria.

    The user selects which of the following types of charaters can be included in the password. 
        Note: at least one character type must be selected.

            * Lowercase letters
            * Uppercase letters
            * Numbers
            * Special characters

    In addition, the user must select their desired password length. 
        Note: the password must be between 8 and 128 characters.

When the "generate password" button is clicked a randomized password will be generated and displayed.
